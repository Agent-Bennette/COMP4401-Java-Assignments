University-student me speaking here, on behalf of high school student me.
This is a paint program I programmed in highschool. It's got some nice functionalities, including the ability to save and load previous drawings. It's not serialized in a super fancy way, just as a text file of string which can be re-opened and saved by entering the pre-extension string of the file names. "Mafia 1" is something the anime-watching me drew. but it's an impressive piece of artwork which demonstrates how the tool works.

Anyways, the program can only be started through the main method in PaintProgram.java. Once that's done, there are a couple of prompts that implement no sanity checks, so be careful about just pressing "okay" without entering values (except for the colour one). I recommend putting "white" as the desired background colour, and I recommend loading "Mafia 1.txt" in the loading feature by entering "Mafia 1".
